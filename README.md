### Hi, my name is Anish Patel.
I am a software engineer and architect based out of London, UK and spend my time at work designing and building software solutions for my clients. In my personal time, I spend my time designing and building software for myself ðŸ˜Š.

I'm currently in the process of building out a large TrueNAS Core system for my homelab for me to use for general storage and for my partner (a Youtuber) to use as a repository for her video content. 

Follow me on Twitter [@codeanish](https://twitter.com/codeanish). I'm a regular tweeter about all technical things I'm working on and would love to hear about what you're working on.
